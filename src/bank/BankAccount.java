/**
 * In this project, you will enhance the {@code BankAccount} class and see how
 * abstraction and encapsulation enable evolutionary changes to software.
 * <p>
 * Begin with a simple enhancement: charging a fee for every deposit and
 * withdrawal. Supply a mechanism for setting the fee and modify the {@code
 * deposit} and {@code withdraw} methods so that the fee is levied. Test your
 * resulting class and check that the fee is computed correctly.
 * <p>
 * Now make a more complex change. The bank will allow a fixed number of free
 * transactions (deposits or withdrawals) every month, and charge for
 * transactions exceeding the free allotment. The charge is not levied
 * immediately but at the end of the month.
 * <p>
 * Supply a new method {@code deductMonthlyCharge} to the {@code BankAccount}
 * class that deducts the monthly charge and resets the transaction count.
 * (Hint: Use {@code Math.max(actual transaction count, free transaction count)}
 * in your computation.)
 * <p>
 * Produce a test program that verifies that the fees are calculated
 * correctly over several months.
