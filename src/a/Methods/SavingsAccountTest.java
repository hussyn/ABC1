 * Write a class {@code SavingsAccount} that is similar to the {@code
 * BankAccount} class, except that it has an added instance variable interest.
 * Supply a constructor that sets both the initial balance and the interest
 * rate. Supply a method {@code addInterest} (with no explicit parameter) that
 * adds interest to the account. Write a {@code SavingsAccountTester} class that
 * constructs a savings account with an initial balance of $1,000 and an
 * interest rate of 10 percent. Then apply the {@code addInterest} method and
 * print the resulting balance. Also compute the expected result by hand and
 * print it.
