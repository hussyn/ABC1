/**
 * Implement a class {@code Employee}. An employee has a name (a string) and a

 * and methods
 * <p><pre>
 *      public String getName()
 *      public double getSalary()
 *      public void raiseSalary(double byPercent)</pre>
 * These methods return the name and salary, and raise the employee's salary by
 * a certain percentage. Sample usage:
 * <p><pre>
 *      Employee harry = new Employee("Hacker, Harry", 50000);
 *      harry.raiseSalary(10); // Harry gets a 10 percent raise</pre>
 * Supply an {@code EmployeeTester} class that tests all methods.
